# MetricAnalysis
run function.py
it asks you for the number of known points, and then the dimension (how many coordinates does the point have)
according to these data, it calculates the values of the function (y = ((matrix(v) * vect (x)), vect(x)) + (vect(c), vect(x)), the elements of the matrix V, vector C and coordinates points are set randomly

run the main.py file. It should output you a corresponding value, which you can compare with what is actually the value of the point in this function.
if you set more than 9 points - it will think for more than 15 minutes exactly
for 9 points I calculated somewhere in 5 minutes
for 8 points about 30 seconds
you can set any dimension, it almost does not affect the time
